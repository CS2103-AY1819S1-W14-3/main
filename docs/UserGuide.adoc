== Introduction


Hospital Management System 2K18 is for hospital administrators, doctors, nurses, and pharmacists who prefer to use a desktop app to manage patients and their associated data.
More importantly, Hospital Management System 2K18 is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Hospital Management System 2K18 can get your hospital management tasks doen faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure that your computer has Java version `9` or later installed.
.  Download the latest release of our application, `hms2k18.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Hospital Management System 2K18.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The Graphical User Interface (GUI) should appear in a few seconds.

+
+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
(The command box is shown in Fig. 1 above; it is the gray box with the words "Enter your commands here..." inside.)

Some example commands you can try:

* *`exit`* : exits the app
* *`select 1`* : selects the first patient (Alex Yeoh in the image above) in the list of patients.

Refer to <<Features>> for the details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
