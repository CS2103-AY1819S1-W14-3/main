== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added `addappt` command
** What it does: adds an appointment for a given patient. Each appointment includes the following information: type of procedure, procedure name, date and time of appointment and the doctor-in-charge
** Justification: this command provides a core functionality of the HMS2K18 (appointment data entry and retrieval).
** Highlights: this command affects existing internal representations of the Person class and required significant retooling of tests to fit the new member of the Person class. The implementation was somewhat challenging as it required an extension of the current Person data representation and storage functionality.
* *Minor enhancement*: incorporate `appt` with the `view` command

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S1-W14-3/main/commits?author=jeffypie369[commits]]
