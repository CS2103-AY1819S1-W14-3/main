//= PROJECT: HealthBase

== 1. Overview
.Project Portfolio
****
This portfolio details the contributions I made to the development of a desktop application as part of an NUS Software Engineering module,
CS2103T. Over the span of 8 weeks in AY18/19 Semester 1, my team and I were given the freedom to morph an existing desktop application
made up of 10KLoC in Java.
****

Throughout the 8-week period, we were challenged to incorporate the new Software Engineering condcepts taught in class
via a series of milestones which were part of the project management process. On top of that, we planned out weekly
goals and consistently reassessed our employed programming methodologies and practices, developing our software HealthBase
incrementally and iteratively. Figure 1 shows the transformation we made in this brownfield project.

.AB4 was morphed into a hospital management system, HealthBase.

HealthBase is a lightweight and free desktop application which automates the tedious data-handling processes of hospital staff.
By complementing the roles of receptionists, nurses and doctors and providing convenient features, the app allows its users to
efficiently manage patients’ information, thus easing their workload and allowing them to focus on caring for their patients.

The app's features can be easily accessed by typing short commands into an input field.
These features include (among others):

* Real-time management of the check-in/out status of patients
* Patient medication data entry and retrieval
* Patient medical history data entry and retrieval
* Patient dietary restriction(s) data entry and retrieval
* Patient visitor history data entry and retrieval
* Real-time management of the number of visitors any given patient has
* Patient appointment management for doctors

== 2. Summary of Contributions

* *Major enhancement*: Added the functionality to record and view patients' past medical diagnoses
** What it does: Records a diagnosis entry into the medical history of a given patient. Each entry includes the diagnosis description, the name of the examining doctor and a timestamp.
** Justification: This feature serves as the primary storage of important patient data, as adjudged by the examining doctor's assessment. Past diagnoses are easily viewed on the desktop application to provide quick access for the examining doctor.
** Highlights: This enhancement required a detailed understanding of the Java Architecture for XML Binding software frame work (JAXB) for data storage as XML files.
Also, the integration of the UI in the feature needed JavaFX knowledge.

== 3. Contributions to the User Guide

|===
| The sections below detail my contributions to the User Guide. They demonstrate my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

=== Add to patient’s medical history: `addmh`
Add a non-blank diagnosis entry with the name of the doctor-in-charge to an existing patient’s medical history.
The patient must be registered within the system.

Format: `addmh ic/NRIC mh/DIAGNOSIS​ doc/DOCTOR-IN-CHARGE`

Example(s):

* `addmh ic/S1234567A mh/Patient shows symptoms of flu. Prescribed 2 weeks of panadol, advised patient to
rest and rehydrate. doc/Dr. Zhang De`
* `addmh ic/T9876543Z mh/Patient appears to have chronic cough. Referred to specialist. doc/Dr.Timothy`

To try out the `addmh` command:

1. Type out a valid `addmh` command which follows the stated format into the command box.
 Such an example can be seen in Figure 2.

2. Submit the input into HealthBase by pressing kbd:[Enter].
The result display panel will show a successful `addmh` command message, and should show Figure 3.

****
WARNING: The following invalid inputs will result in a command failure, and the display of an appropriate error message.

* Invalid NRIC
** The patient NRIC does not match to an existing patient in the system. The person will first need to be registered.
* Incorrect format of the doctor's name.
** Doctor's title must be included.
** The first letter of all words in doctor's name must be captalised.
* Blank diagnosis
** An empty diagnosis will not be accepted as a valid diagnosis.
* Missing prefixes
** Not all the prefixes in the stated command format have been included.
****
[TIP]
====
If you want to view the newly added diagnoses to a particular patient, simply enter `view mh`.
You may have to enter select <patient index>` or click on the patient panel card.
To use the full capabilities of the `view` command, click <<#view-command, here>>.
